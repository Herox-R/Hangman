# Hangman 
This app is a simple Hangman game where the user tries to guess a word based on a word that's partially hidden. The app picks a word from a predefined list, hides some of its letters (replacing them with underscores), and the user has to guess the word.

# Word List:
- driver
- signature
- history
- response
- president
- highway
- computer
- apartment
- forest
- chocolate
- lawyer

# How it works:
1. Starting the Game: The user presses the "Start" button, which initializes the game by resetting the score and displaying a word with some missing letters.
2. Guessing the Word: The user types a guess in the textbox and clicks the "Next" button.
- If the guess is correct, the app shows "Correct" in green and increases the score.
- If the guess is wrong, it shows "Wrong" in red.
3. Progressing: After each guess, the app moves to the next word until all words have been guessed.
4. End of Game: When all words are guessed, the "Start" button is re-enabled, allowing the user to start over.
5. This app provides a fun way to test your word-guessing skills with feedback and a score tracker.
